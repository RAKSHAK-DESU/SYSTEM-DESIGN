# Polymorphism Notes

## Definition
- Same interface, different implementations.

## Dynamic Polymorphism (Runtime)
- Achieved via method overriding and inheritance.
- Uses `@Override` annotation in Java.
- Base class methods are overridden by derived classes.

## Static Polymorphism (Compile-time)
- Achieved via method overloading.
- Same method name, different parameters.

## Real-life examples
- Animals running differently (Duck, Human, Tiger).
- Car accelerating differently depending on type.

## Benefits
- Code flexibility and extensibility.
- Enables modular, maintainable software design.
