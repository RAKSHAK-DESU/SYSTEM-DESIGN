# System Design Notes â€“ Day 2: OOPS Pillars

This repository contains concise notes and Java code examples to understand the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Java Examples
Real-world `Car` and `SportsCar` classes are used to demonstrate these concepts.

## ðŸ”¹ Abstraction
- Hides unnecessary implementation details.
- Exposes only what is necessary.
- Eg: You operate a TV with a remote without knowing its internal circuitry.

## ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation
- Wrapping of data (variables) and methods in one unit (class).
- Like a capsuleâ€”it hides internal complexity.

```java
class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;

    public void start() { /* behavior */ }
    public void stop() { /* behavior */ }
}
